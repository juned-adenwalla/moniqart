                Art therapy is a type of psychotherapy that involves the use of art materials, such as paints, clay, drawing materials, pencils colors, markers, gel pens, papier mache, etc. to help individuals express themselves and explore their emotions. Through the creative process, individuals can gain insight into their thoughts and feelings, and develop coping skills to manage emotional challenges.

                Art therapy can be particularly helpful for people who struggle to express themselves verbally, such as children or individuals with developmental disabilities. It can also be used to help individuals cope with a range of emotional and psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, trauma, and grief.

                Art therapy sessions are typically led by a licensed art therapist who has received specialized training in both art and psychotherapy. The therapist may provide prompts or exercises to guide the individual's creative process, or may simply allow them to freely create.

                Overall, art therapy can be a powerful tool for self-discovery, emotional healing, and personal growth.

                Visual art or drawing and coloring in common knowledge is a specific training where you train your mind to look at something for a long period of time in order to duplicate it and transform it and while doing so the brain develops a greater attention span. A child who practices art on a regular basis will develop belief patterns pertaining to self, which will increase self-esteem and a higher sense of achievement. Such children go on to perform better in almost every field. The continuous practice of any art form of the child's choice will result in maximum development. The child should not be forced or obligated into practicing art, then, there are developmental hazards.

                Secondly is a very relaxing activity, where a child's mind becomes fresh, apart from the technical knowledge that is gained. Art cannot be learned as a crash course, so expecting results before time is like making an egg hatch before its time. Patience and perseverance both are learned by a student. In my experience, many students have personally validated the therapeutic effects of art. According to Shloka Dhanu a student of Moniqart Drawing School, "Art is a better way of releasing your stress. It makes you a better person in control of emotion." In certain children, art can be used as an intervention to correct behavioral issues, in which case the sessions should be one on one or in a group in which all have the same requirement.

                For example, we worked with a child with severe stress symptoms where she would vomit every time after visiting a new place. After three months of art classes regularly taken, her self-esteem increased and she became stress-free, such are the benefits of regular art training. Not only does your stress reduce, but it is also a form of meditation and a trusted skill.

                    In psychology, the use of artistic methods to treat psychological disorders and enhance mental health is known as art therapy.
                    Art therapy is a therapeutic technique rooted in the idea that creative expression can foster healing and mental well-being.
                    AATA, American Art Therapy Association-  definition of the profession:
                    Art therapy is the therapeutic use of art-making, within a professional relationship, by people who experience illness, trauma, or challenges in living, and by people who seek personal development.
                    ABT or Arts Based Therapy is defined as the evidence–based use of art forms (music, dance, drama, and visual arts.) to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship. ABT is primarily an art form, practiced scientifically, and based on the subtle energy theory. The subtle energy theory states that reality is a perception, based on sensory input and cognition. Change in any of these will lead to a different reality. ABT is a model developed by WCCL Foundation.
                    Art Therapist Mona Joy is a master-level clinician who works with people of all ages across a broad spectrum. people who are challenged with medical and mental health problems, as well as individuals seeking emotional, creative, and spiritual growth.
